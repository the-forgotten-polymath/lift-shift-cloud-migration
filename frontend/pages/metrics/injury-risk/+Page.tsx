          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Injury Risk card scores every joint you train from 0 to 100 percent. Lower is safer. The score is an estimate of how much recent training stress a joint is under &mdash; it is not a prediction of injury and not medical advice. A spike above 40 percent suggests considering a deload or rebalancing your program.
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The score combines three factors, each shown color-coded in the card: <strong className="text-white">workload</strong> (this week&rsquo;s sets vs. your 4-week average, mirroring the acute:chronic workload ratio), <strong className="text-white">recovery</strong> (back-to-back days training the same joint), and <strong className="text-white">balance</strong> (volume ratio between an antagonist pair, e.g. quads vs. hamstrings).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">How it is calculated</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Workload ratio</strong> &mdash; sets on the joint this week divided by the 4-week rolling average. A ratio above ~1.3 is elevated; higher spikes push the score up sharply.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Recovery</strong> &mdash; counts consecutive days the joint was worked. Each back-to-back day increases the recovery component.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Antagonist balance</strong> &mdash; compares weekly sets between opposing muscle groups around the joint. Large imbalances (e.g. far more pressing than pulling) add to the score.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4 mt-4">
            Muscles are attributed to joints through the exercise-to-muscle mapping used across LiftShift, with warm-up sets excluded and secondary muscles weighted lower.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">How to use it</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Load management</strong> &mdash; if a joint&rsquo;s score climbs week over week, reduce frequency or volume on the exercises that hit it hardest.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Program balance</strong> &mdash; a high balance component points at an antagonist pair, e.g. add pulling volume if pressing dominates.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Deload timing</strong> &mdash; scores above 40 are a reasonable cue to schedule a deload week.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">Limitations</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            <li>The score is derived only from what you log. Technique, sleep, stress, and existing conditions are invisible to it.</li>
            <li>It estimates relative training stress, not injury probability. A low score does not guarantee safety, and a high score does not mean you will get injured.</li>
            <li>ACWR-style metrics are most meaningful with consistent logging over several weeks. Short histories produce noisier scores.</li>
          </ul>
