          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For related exercises (same joint, same action family), lifters reliably show predictable strength ratios &mdash; for example, an overhead press is typically 60&ndash;70% of a bench press, and a squat is typically 1.3&ndash;1.5&times; a bench press. LiftShift computes your ratio for 13 such pairs and compares it against population statistics (roughly 28 million logged lifts for the highest-confidence pairs).
          </p>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When your ratio falls outside the typical band, LiftShift surfaces it as a <strong className="text-white">watch</strong> (borderline) or <strong className="text-white">flag</strong> (far outside), with the lagging exercise linked for inspection. A flagged ratio is a hint &mdash; it can mean a real imbalance, different training history, or a logging difference &mdash; never a verdict on your form.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong className="text-white">Window</strong> &mdash; the last 90 days of training.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Per session</strong> &mdash; the best estimated 1RM of the session (Epley formula, weight &times; (1 + reps/30), working sets of 5&ndash;15 reps, warm-ups excluded).</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Strength level</strong> &mdash; the 75th percentile of your 5 most recent session bests, so one-off PRs or stale peaks don&rsquo;t dominate.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Unilateral lifts</strong> &mdash; per-arm exercises (lateral raises, dumbbell presses) are doubled so they compare fairly against bilateral totals.</li>
            <li><strong className="text-white">Minimum data</strong> &mdash; both sides of a pair need at least 2 sessions in the window, and the data overall needs at least 3 sessions, before anything is reported.</li>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">Reading the trend chart</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Each finding shows your weekly laggard percentage &mdash; the weaker lift as a % of the stronger one &mdash; over the last 3 months, with the typical band shaded green and a dot marking your current level. The line is smoothed with a 3-week average. A chip above the chart says whether the gap is <strong className="text-white">closing</strong> or <strong className="text-white">widening</strong>, based on the last ~5 weeks only (a recent slide isn&rsquo;t masked by earlier progress), with fitted start and end values, e.g. &ldquo;Gap closing &middot; 50% &rarr; 60% over 2 months&rdquo;.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">Limitations</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            <li>Ratio bands are population statistics. Individual body mechanics, leverages, and training history vary &mdash; treat bands as references, not rules.</li>
            <li>Machine weights differ across brands, and technique conventions (range of motion, tempo) affect ratios.</li>
            <li>Low-experience lifters have compressed ratios; the minimum-session guards exist for this reason.</li>
            <li>The metric is a hint for your next sessions, not a diagnosis or injury claim.</li>
          </ul>
