          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            LiftShift reads your workout history (exercises, sets, reps, weights, dates, notes) from Hevy, Strong, or Lyfta to compute analytics locally. This includes exercise names, set-level data, workout dates, and any notes or RPE/RIR values you&rsquo;ve logged. Muscle mapping is done client-side using a built-in exercise-to-muscle database.

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-white mb-3">Where data is processed</h2>
          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            All computation &mdash; heatmap generation, plateau detection, set-by-set analysis, PR tracking, and AI export formatting &mdash; happens entirely in your browser using IndexedDB. LiftShift does not upload your workout data to a server for processing. The only network requests are to the Hevy API (if you use API sync instead of CSV import) and to fetch the LiftShift application code itself.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            <li><strong>Your workout data</strong> &mdash; stored locally in your browser&rsquo;s IndexedDB. This never leaves your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Application preferences</strong> &mdash; platform selection, date filter ranges, and UI settings are stored in localStorage.</li>
            <li><strong>Anonymous page view analytics</strong> &mdash; LiftShift uses Google Analytics to track anonymous page views (URLs visited, no workout data). You can block this with any ad blocker or by disabling JavaScript.</li>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
            <li>Your full training history is never stored on LiftShift servers.</li>
            <li>Your Hevy, Strong, or Lyfta account credentials are never seen by LiftShift. Hevy API auth uses OAuth and LiftShift never receives your password. CSV imports are processed entirely in-browser.</li>
            <li>LiftShift does not use cookies beyond what the app itself needs to function (localStorage preferences).</li>
            <li>No personal identifiers (name, email, location) are collected or stored by LiftShift.</li>

          <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            While LiftShift does not store your data, <strong>the third-party apps you connect to (Hevy, Strong, Lyfta) do</strong>. LiftShift has no control over their data practices. If you use Hevy API sync, Hevy&rsquo;s servers will process your request and transmit your workout history to your browser. Review each app&rsquo;s privacy policy for details on how they handle your data.
